#### Problem to Solve ####

Black Scholes model is the earliest, fundamental closed-form algorithm for pricing European call option. It makes some unrealistic assumptions such as stock price should follow geometric Brownian motion and the implied volatility should be constant. To tackle the limitation, stochastic volatility models like Variance Gamma, Heston, and Bates grow up. However, these models usually need lots of time to do the calibration i.e. for every option with n different strike prices, the bias (can be measured by mean square error) between option market price and option model price should be minimized that usually has to take another n steps to compute. 
$$
MSE = \frac{1}{\text{number of options}}\sum_\text{options}\frac{(\text{option market price } - \text{ option model price})^2}{\text{market price}}
$$
Hence, Carr and Maden develop a fast Fourier transform (FFT) method for option pricing in 1999 which overall only takes nlog⁡n steps. If the close form of the characteristic function of the stock log price's risk-neutral density function is known, FFT method can give a more efficient way to compute the option price than those stochastic volatility models. This project's purpose is to implement the FFT option pricing method. Since most of the implementation only uses high-level language like python and Matlab, here I will use low-level language C++ to implement and optimize it. The program will finally bind to python for python users.

2. Fourier transform modified call option price to get $\psi_T(x)$

   > $$

   > $$
   > \begin{align}
   > C(k_u) &= \frac{\exp(-\alpha k_u)}{\pi} \sum_{j=1}^N e^{-i \frac{2\pi}{N}(j-1)(u-1)}e^{ibv_j}\psi(v_j)\frac{\eta}{3}(3+(-1)^j-\delta_{j-1})\\
