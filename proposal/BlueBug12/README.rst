SAAF : a Simulated-Annealing Algorithm Framework
================================================

Basic information
=================
| SAAF is a user-friendly framework that helps users to develop a simulated-annealing based algorithm easily, and provides some related 
| function to show the execution result.

Problem to solve
=================
| In the computer science domain, there are plenty of problems that have been proved to be NP-complete. As we know, there is still no 
| polynomial-time algorithm to solve those problems efficiently. Therefore, heuristic algorithms become useful when we are dealing with
| them, and simulated-annealing( SA for short) is one of the well-known and effective heuristic algorithm. The name of the algorithm comes
| from annealing in metallurgy, a technique involving heating and cooling of a material to change its physical properties. The first step 
| is to heat up a material until it reaches an annealing temperature, then cool it down slowly in order to change the material to a desired
| structure. The "heat up and cool down" process is actually the key idea of SA algorithm. It provides a effective way to a approximate 
| solution to the global optimum in the search space, and avoid being trapped at the local minimum. Therefore it is very useful when we are
| dealing with some difficult computational otimization problems.

| However, it usually takes time to develop a simulated-annealing based algorithm. Sometimes, it is challenging to define a proper objec-
| tive function(we call it "energy state" in SA) to help us search the optimal solution, and there are a lot of combinations of parameters 
| that need to be tested. As a result, I want to develop a user-friendly SA framework which can help users to verify and evaluate their 
| idea in a short time. On the other hand, SA algorithm is usually time-consuming, so it's suitable to use hybrid architecture to implement
| it to strike a balance between flexibility and performance.

Perspective users
=================
* Software developers that need to quickly develop a prototype using SA-based algorithms. 
* Researchers who want to verify their preliminary ideas to solve the problem with SA-based algorithms.
* Students who want to practice and experience some SA-based algorithms. 


System architecture
===================
| Except the user-defined functions, basically all API call C++ packages to do numerical calculation in order to get the better performance.
| The framework provide a flexible user defined function to make sure it can satisfy different problem formulations and user requirements.

| After the algorithm terminate, user can choose how to show the calculation ressult(in terminal, text file or diagram).
