# Fourier Transform for Image Processing
## Basic Information
* GitHub repository: https://github.com/crystal0523/nsdhw_21au/tree/crystal0523-proposal-submission/proposal/crystal0523
## Problem to Solve

The Fourier Transform is used in a wide range of image applications, which transform the signal from time domain to frequency domain, such as image analysis, image filtering, image reconstruction and image compression.

The formula of 2-D Discrete Fourier Transform for an M*N image:
> $\dfrac{1}{M*N}\sum_{x=0}^{M-1}\sum_{y=0}^{N-1}f(x,y)e^{-i2\pi[\dfrac{ux}{M}+\dfrac{vy}{N}]}$, for u = 0..M-1, v = 0..N-1
