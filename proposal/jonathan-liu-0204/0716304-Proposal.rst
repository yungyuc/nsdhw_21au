===================
Problem to Solve
===================
When studying Data Structure and Object Orienting, the Red-Black Tree problem is the most common problem to most students, without a doubt.
The main reason that confuses is usually the lack of visualization tools. 
Besides, Red-Black Trees are generally the ones that caused the most confusion. 
Hence, I would like to build a dynamic visualization tool for Red-Black Tree.
