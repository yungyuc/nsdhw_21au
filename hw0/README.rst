Homework assignment #0
======================

This is a demonstration of NSD 21AU homework.

To turn in your homework, you need **a PR** and **an E3 entry for the PR URL**.

Your PR needs to be created against the ``hw0`` branch.  (Not ``master``!)  The
name of your branch needs to start with ``<github-user-name>-hw#``, e.g.,
``username-hw2-attempt1``.  You need to create a sub-directory using exactly
your GitHub username as your working directory
(``nsdhw_21au/hw0/$github-user-name/``).  The hierarchy should be::

  - nsdhw_21au (<- repository root)
    - hw0
      - username (<- your working directory)
        - Your files

In **every commit** in your PR, you can only change the files in your working
directory.  You may not touch anything else.  Failure to follow the rule can
cost you points.

Please make sure your PR passes the Github Action CI, and is compatible with
the latest NSD AMI on AWS (it uses Ubuntu 20.04 LTS) in ``us-east-1``.  You are
not required to use the AMI for doing the homework, but the grader is.  If your
code fails to build or run on it, **you can lose all points**.

Everyone should write his/her own code.  It is OK to discuss, but there should
not be duplicated code.  If duplication is found, **all points** for the
duplicated part of the latter submitter may be deducted.

Question

1. Run ``countline.py``.
